Refactor the entire codebase
- Remove redundant methods and functions in both the client and the server
- Wherever possible, combine related things into reusable functions
- Fix common bugs with state management, issues with hooks, etc
- Remove the seperate type reminder from the client entirely (its redundant)
- Research best user functionality and security practices, and migrate towards following them

Imminent tasks:
- For every item (tasks, events, study sessions), users should be able to attach reminders and a recurrence pattern
- Fix bugs related to study sessions (ie as soon as the user navigates away the session resets)
- Unified functions to send prompts to chatbot 
    (currently there are three different things: regular chat, conflict suggestion, and autoscheduling)
- Improve and condense onboarding
- Simplify and make the UI as convenient as possible (example: use the new date picker instead of the crappy old one)
- Make it a PWA

Features to Work on Soon:
- Scheduled notification system
- Autoscheduling should not just be study sessions but also tasks and events
- "What do you want to accomplish today?" popup should come every day.
    - People should be able to select from certain options/recommendations or type their own
    - AI will automatically plan out the user's day accordingly
- Basic gamification

More future down the line:
- Add AI insights to scheduled notification system (it will automatically happen on certain triggers)
- More integrations (google classroom, gmail, notion, todoist, apple calendar). The app will be a place where everything can be seen at once
- Native app functionality (ios and android)
- Catches when people are off task and notifies them (ie ur watching brainrot on reels instead of studying during your study time)
