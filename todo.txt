Frontend:
PRIORITY: Get google calendar working - in-progress
- Problem: Off by 5 hours only for calendar events, probably related to timezone issues
- Problem: Any updates don't get synced back to google calendar
- Solution: When task/event is updated, sync possible fields back to google calendar.
PRIORITY: If a description is too long for a task, event or study session enable a collapse and view more button. DO NOT EXTEND THE PAGE, ESPECIALLY ON MOBILE
