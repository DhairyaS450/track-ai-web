Overall:
Deploy to vercel
Convert to PWA
Release on App Store and Play Store

Frontend:
Priority: Study sessions are broken completely
Chatbot:
- Enable adding attachments to messages
- Allow it to display visuals such as calendars, charts, etc
- Allow it to display images, videos, etc
PRIORITY: Get google calendar working - in-progress
- Problem: Google tasks not fully implemented, and off by 5 hrs
- Problem: Any updates don't get synced back to google calendar
- Solution: When task/event is updated, sync possible fields back to google calendar.
PRIORITY: When certain fields of a task are updated, it should update the associated deadline as well
PRIORITY: When certain fields of an event are updated, it should update the associated reminders as well
PRIORITY: If a description is too long for a task, event or study session enable a collapse and view more button. DO NOT EXTEND THE PAGE, ESPECIALLY ON MOBILE
